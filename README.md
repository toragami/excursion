# excursion
For anyone out there: I found myself very frustrated by this project. For some reason I could not get my HTML page to link to the CSS page. I went through all my notes and believe I placed the CSS page link in the correct spot with the correct code. Nevertheless, no matter what I put on the CSS page and though I put the correct code in the HTML, the brower would not read accordingly.
I had some CSS/HTML issues with the previous project (Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts) although there I was able to get some CSS action on my HTML page.
So, because I am far behind the appropriate timeline, I laid this project out in HTML with the CSS added inline. If anyone reads this note and checks my work, should you see why I cannot link my HTML to the CSS I'd really appreciate the correction.
I'm working in Atom: is there a possibility I have a flawed download?
